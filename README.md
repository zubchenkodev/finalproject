Hi! 

My project is using React/ Redux Toolkit to create and save the notes, that any studend might need during any course. The main functionality is an ability to create a folder, chose it's category, create notes within this folder and delete them. Each note can combination of 3 type of content ( as many of each as needed and in any order): subtitles to separate the text, text blocks and 'code' blocks. Also each note can be marked/ unmarked as favorite or as well learned. 

Notes in each folder can be sorted and filtered.

Homepage holds information about favorite notes, well learned notes and chart of most popular categories. New categories can also be added on the homepage.

All the data is stored in the local storage, so there is no data at the beginning.
